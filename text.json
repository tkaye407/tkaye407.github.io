			"info"  : "I have always been a fierce competitor in any sport that I have played. In high school I fell in love with Track and Field. I had always been a longer-distance runner, but with track I found a great community of athletes and a sport built on personal goals and competition. Then when I went to college I decided to play Sprint Football, a sport I had never played before, but it was an amazing experience nonetheless."
